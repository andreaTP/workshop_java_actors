=== What

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model[actor model definition] from 1973.

The actor model adopts the philosophy that everything is an actor.
An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:

  * send a finite number of messages to other actors;
  * create a finite number of new actors;
  * designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.

=== Why

Why the actor model matters:

  * Modelling stateful systems
  * Distributed systems (e.g. leveraging location transparency)
  * IoT (e.g. Digital twins)
  * ...

=== How

BOM of technologies/ instruments we are going to use.

==== Java 19

Features we are going to leverage:

  * records
  * record patterns
  * expression switches
  * sealed type hierarchies
  * virtual threads

==== JBang
